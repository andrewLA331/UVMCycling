        <h2>Club Team</h2>
        
        <p>Student run, student funded. We do more with less, and we're goddamn proud of it. Reigning ECCC Division 1 champs in MTB and Road for too many seasons to count. We've won national championships with mustaches and mullets. Vermont winters make us hard, and so does your mom.</p>
        
        <p>Iconoclastic. Ostentatious. Egregious. A force of nature. We wear our hearts on our sleeves, and our jorts short enough to risk public exposure. Cycling today is a science, but winning is nothing without panache.</p>
